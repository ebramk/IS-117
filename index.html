<h1>Welcome to Ebram's website!</h1>

<p> Hi there,<br><b>Thank you for visiting my website :)</b><br>My name is Ebram Kerolos and I am a Junior majoring in Information Technology and Computer Science. I was born in Egypt and me and my family came to the United States in 2008. We have been living in Jersey City, NJ ever since. I  enjoy playing soccer, taking photos, and building and taking apart computers. I also enjoy coding with Java and Python and I'm always looking to learn more coding languages.

<blockquote> From 1991 to 1999, HTML developed from version 1 to version 4. 

In year 2000, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended XHTML 1.0. The XHTML syntax was strict, and the developers were forced to write valid and "well-formed" code.

In 2004, W3C's decided to close down the development of HTML, in favor of XHTML.

In 2004, WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) was formed. The WHATWG wanted to develop HTML, consistent with how the web was used, while being backward compatible with older versions of HTML.
