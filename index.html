<h1>Welcome to Ebram's website!</h1>

Hi there,<br>Thank you for visiting my website :)<br>My name is Ebram Kerolos and I am a Junior majoring in Information Technology and Computer Science. I was born in Egypt and me and my family came to the United States in 2008. We have been living in Jersey City, NJ ever since. I  enjoy playing soccer, taking photos, and building and taking apart computers. I also enjoy coding with Java and Python and I'm always looking to learn more coding languages.
